    title: 'What is coronavirus and how worried should we be?',
    subtitle: 'News',
    date: 'November, 15 2019',
    content: `What is the virus causing the illness in Wuhan?
t is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.
        
Have there been other coronaviruses?
New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.
        
What are the symptoms caused by the Wuhan coronavirus?
The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.`,

    content: `Ok, it’s admittedly been a very busy week for the music industry, with dramatic new developments in the Grammys scandal happening left and right, but there are other important things happening, too, that need to be covered, particularly in the pop world. Whether you’ve been won over to the dreamy K-pop world yet or not — and if you’re not, be prepared to be soon, there’s no avoiding how spectacularly good this music is — BTS is unequivocally one of the biggest and best pop acts in the world right now, and they just announced a huge stadium tour this year.

Like Philip Cosores wrote back in 2018 in a review of their tour launch at Staples Center, “even if you aren’t keen to the latest pop sensations, there really isn’t an excuse to be oblivious to BTS at this point.” On this year’s trek, they’ll be hitting LA three separate times, with two dates at Levi Stadium and another at the Rose Bowl, along with several other dates in major American cities, and international ones like Barcelona, Berlin and more. Check out the full stretch of live shows below, and do yourself a favor, get familiar with BTS.`,

    content: `Few sporting events have the scale and logistics challenges that the Tour de France presents. Event organizer ASO uses the cloud and tight physical security to avoid cyberattacks and broadcast integrity.
        
Once a rarity, cyber incidents in the sporting industry are becoming common. While sports organizations have large amounts of sensitive, valuable information, the incidents themselves are often tied to the political climate.

The 2018 South Korean Winter Olympic Games were hit by a cyberattack during the opening ceremony. The attack – known as OlympicDestroyer and thought to be a Russian-sponsored attack in retaliation for barring entry for its athletes – brought down services including the official ticketing app. The attack also targeted the event’s IT services provider.
                
Both the World Anti-Doping Agency and athletics governing body World Athletics have been hacked in recent years, leaking medical data on many of the world’s athletes. FIFA has also suffered information leaks following a breach.
                
The fact that so many people watch sporting events makes broadcasts attractive targets for attackers with a message. Islamist hackers have attacked French and Israeli broadcasts in recent years, including disrupting the Eurovision song contest to send false missile alerts.`,

    title: 'Subway graffiti makes a bit of a comeback',
    subtitle: 'Art',
    date: 'November, 15 2019',
    content: `NEW YORK - A New York City police union recently tweeted a video of an entire subway train covered by graffiti. The PBA called it a "true sign of decay."

But what do you think when you see the video?
                
FOX 5 NY wanted the perspective of Chris Freedom Pape, a legendary graffiti artist. He said that a lot of people come from out of town to paint subway cars because learned about graffiti art from New York. So they consider painting a train a "huge badge of honor."
                
In the 1970s, tagging led to the surge in property crimes. Crackdowns and tougher laws followed. These days, the MTA spends hundreds of thousands each year to remove graffiti.
                
New York City Transit President Andy Byford called graffiti "selfish" and "vandalism." He said a vandalized subway has to be taken out of service to be cleaned, which affects service for commuters.

While some say this is a sign of urban decay, Byford and Pape agreed that we are not in danger of going back to a rougher era. Byford said that he has seen the pictures of tagged subways from the 1970s and 1980s and that the current problem is nowhere nearly as bad.
                
In many ways, graffiti is more legitimate and understood today than it was in the 1970s or 1980s. But those who have been involved in the movement from the beginning say that street art—however illegal or unwelcome—may always be needed to keep graffiti relevant.
                
"I still think need the shock and awe and the illegal act of graffiti or it's as though there's not a pulse anymore," Pape said.
                
So how would he judge the graffiti seen in the video?
                
Pape said that based on the artist's philosophy, he gives it an "A" but based on the quality of the graffiti on old subways, he gives it a "C."
                
Evidently, New York standards are still as tough as the 1970s and 1980s.`,

    title: 'Three popular diets plus fasting linked to big health benefits',
    subtitle: 'Fashion',
    date: 'November, 15 2019',
    content: `Three popular diets alongside the habit of not eating for significant periods of time have been linked to important health benefits that extend beyond weight loss. The findings come from the University of Otago, which reports that things like lowered blood sugar and blood pressure as among the benefits associated with these diets and fasting, each assessed in a ‘real world’ setting.

Trendy diets come and go, but some manage to stick around for long periods of time, even earning endorsements from health organizations and recommendations from doctors. One such diet is the popular Mediterranean diet, which has repeatedly been linked to various positive health changes in many studies over the years. Two other popular dieting protocols evaluated by the recent study are Intermittent Fasting and Paleo diets.
        
Researchers studied all three of these diets with the goal of seeing how effective they are in the real world rather than a clinical one, meaning the participants — all 250 of them — were tasked with picking which diet they preferred and sticking to it on their own without any continued support from a dietician.
        
The study found that all three dieting protocols conferred health benefits, though certain diets were more associated with select benefits than others. Intermittent fasting, for example, which involves going 12 to 18 hours without eating, was linked with greater weight loss — this isn’t a surprise considering that the participants only ate around 500 calories per day on two days per week.
        
Compared to this, the participants who went on a Mediterranean diet were more likely to experience improved blood sugar levels. Both fasting and the Mediterranean diet were linked with ‘significant improvements’ in the participants’ blood pressure measurements, as well. Controlling blood pressure is an important factor in reducing the risks of heart disease and a number of other health issues.`,

    subtitle: 'Fashion',
    date: 'November, 15 2019',
    content: `San Diego was included because of “irresponsible breeding, severing bonds and treating elephants like expendable assets,” according to In Defense of Animals, a San Rafael organization that has been compiling the list since 2004 and has long been opposed to elephants being kept in zoos. This is the second time San Diego has been included.

“We do the list every year to draw attention to the fact that elephants suffer in captivity,” said Laura Bridgeman, director of the group’s elephant campaign. “No amount of space, financial investment or enrichment in public display facilities can completely eliminate the physical and psychological harm that captivity perpetuates for elephants.”
        
San Diego Zoo Global officials did not respond to multiple requests by phone and email for their reaction to the list, which was released Thursday. They have two Asian elephants and one African elephant at the zoo, and nine African bush elephants at the Safari Park.`,
